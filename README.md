# ðŸ“Š Grafana Playground Env Setup
This project provides a lightweight and reproducible Grafana monitoring environment using Terraform and Minikube. Itâ€™s ideal for local experimentation, dashboard prototyping, or learning observability tools without needing a cloud setup.

## ðŸ”§ What's Included
Terraform configuration to deploy:

 - Grafana
 - Prometheus
 - Loki + Promtail (for logs)
 - Preconfigured data sources in Grafana (Prometheus & Loki)
 - Example spring-boot app

Comment:  To simplify deployment [Loki Stack Helm Chart](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/loki-stack/README.md) has been used 

Automation scripts to:
 - Check and start Minikube if it's not running
 - Deploy the full monitoring stack locally
 - Simplify environment teardown and rebuilds
